Graphics note for implementation


* For the RPS Minigame the background is already present in the files
* Do not show the opponent’s choice until the player choses
* Somehow show the title of the minigame before or during gameplay


* Show the title for all minigames for clarity


* The sprites for the Ender Dragon and Tomato Dodge are in the items sprite sheet
